# React Movie App
This is a simple movie app built with React and CSS along with the TMDB API.

## Concepts used
1. react-router-dom : This is used to handle routing in the app. This can be installed as a packge via `npm install react-router-dom`
2. hooks : These are special functions that allow us to use state and other features in functional components.
3. context : This is a way to pass data between components without having to pass props down through multiple levels.
4. api : This is a way to get data from an external source.
5. css : This is a way to style the app.

Particular details about the code are in the comments in the code files.

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following line: `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`
